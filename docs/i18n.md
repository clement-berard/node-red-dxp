# Internationalisation (i18n)

::: warning
Documentation is still a work in progress. But the package is fully functional and ready to use.
:::

## Config files

### Global (available in all nodes)

For example, add a file `src/locals/en-US.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "hello": "Hello"
}
```

This will make the `hello` key available in all nodes.

### Scoped (available in a specific node)



## Usage

### In editor HTML

You can follow [official doc](https://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/i18n) but with one important difference:

**You don't need to prefix the key with the node name. Just use the key directly.**

For example. In the file `src/nodes/my_node/editor/index.html`:

✅ Good

```html
<span data-i18n="foo"></span>
```

❌ Bad

```html
<span data-i18n="my_node.foo"></span>
```

::: warning
`foo` must be defined in the global or scoped node config files.

### In scripts
