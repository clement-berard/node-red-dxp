# `watch` command

The `watch` command continuously monitors changes in the `src` directory by default, automatically triggering a rebuild and restarting the local Node-RED server.

If needed, the Node-RED server launch can be disabled via the configuration.

Additionally, it includes BrowserSync integration, which refreshes the browser automatically whenever changes are detected, ensuring a seamless development workflow. ðŸš€

Refer to the [config file](../config-file.md) for more information.

  }
}
