# Resources

::: warning Under construction 🚧
Documentation is still a work in progress. But the package is fully functional and ready to use.
:::

```sh{3}
├── src/
│   ├── nodes/ # Your nodes (mandatory)
└── resources/ # Your resources folder (optional)
└── package.json
```

For now, you can add your resources in the `resources` folder (js, css) and they will be included in the final package.

::: warning ⚠️
You must publish the `resources` folder in the final package (to the npm registry).
